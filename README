Installing Merlin
=================

Compilation
-----------

Needed: OCaml 4, ocamlfind, ocamlbuild, yojson, menhir

Merlin requires OCaml >=4.00.1 (may work with newer versions, but it is tightly
bound to compiler internals).
Then ensures that "yojson" and "menhir" are installed and are registered in ocamlfind.

$ make

Don't panic if you encounters a lot of warnings. It's to workaround an ocamlbuild
bug causing it to not pass arguments to menhir.

Installation
------------

Rename ocamlmerlin.native to ocamlmerlin and makes it accessible from the PATH.

Setting-up vim
--------------

Once ocamlmerlin can be found in vim's PATH, just
  :source merlin.vim
